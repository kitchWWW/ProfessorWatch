# Professor Watch Chrome Extension
An extension that surfaces Title IX findings and those of major news sources to the UT course catalogue.

The description in the chrome store for the extension is below:

---


At UT-Austin, professors who have violated sexual misconduct policies are still teaching. Over the past several years, activism on the part of students and faculty has led to the release of some of their names. This chrome extension brings this public information directly into the course catalogue so you can stay informed when signing up for classes. Names are linked to the UT Austin Sexual Misconduct Database, where you can read the allegations and summary review of the incident to make your own determination on what you want to do during registration.

Color code meanings:
Red: UT's Title IX Office found the professor violated sexual misconduct policies.
Orange: A major media outlet has reported allegations of sexually abusive or predatory behavior by the professor, but the Title IX Office has NOT found a violation.

This extension was not created nor is endorsed by the University.
